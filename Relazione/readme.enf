This is the readme file for the endfloat package v2.4i

This readme was modified on October 2, 1997 but without
updated endfloat itself, instead to fix errors in this file
and in endfloat.ins

It was again modified on March 31, 2006, by Frank Küster
<frank@kuesterei.ch> to indicate the license clarification (see below). 

Endfloat is a LaTeX package.  Versions 2.1 and above require
LaTeX2e.

Accompanying files should be:

	readme.txt (or readme.endfloat)	This file
	endfloat.dtx			Docstrip archive  (essential)
	endfloat.ins			(La)TeX batch file (if you
					    don't know what it is
					    then you DO need it)
        endfloat.asc			PGP separate signature for
					    endfloat.dtx (to check
					    authenticity)

============================================================
Overview:
  the package places figures and tables at the end of the document,
  as often requested by journals for non-camera ready submission.

========================================================
Installation:

Run

  latex endfloat.ins

This will produce three files, endfloat.sty, endfloat.drv and efxmpl.cfg .
You can run LaTeX on endfloat.drv for the documentation.
  
You should copy the file endfloat.sty to where you keep
your (La)TeX inputs.  You should read the documentation to find out
more about the example configuration file, efxmpl.cfg.

To produce the documentation, run LaTeX on endfloat.drv (or endfloat.dtx)
a couple of times, and then use the makeindex program (which might be
called makeindx on your system) to generate the index

 makeindex -g -s gind.ist endfloat

Then run LaTeX (at least) two more times to get the index in the table
of contents.

=========================================================
Major changes in version 2.4 since 2.3:
  Configuration file (with example of getting sidewaystable to work),
  Many new hooks for more user control.  Internal changes.

Major changes in version 2.3 and 2.2 since 2.1:
  Documentation and many internal changes.
  Added options for suppressing "Tables" and "Figures" section heads, for
  switching order of tables and figures.  Use of package options
  generally.

Maintainer:  Jeff Goldberg (J.Goldberg@Cranfield.ac.uk)
Original author: James Darrell McCauley

Obtaining endfloat:  The necessary files are kept on the Comprehensive
TeX Archive Network (CTAN).  Current CTAN sites are ftp.tex.ac.uk,
ftp.shsu.edu, and ftp.dante.de.  They are also mirrored at other locations.
Once on CTAN, type the command "quote site index endfloat" to
find where endfloat lives.  It is probably in
macros/latex/contrib/supported/endfloat .
Get the whole directory.

Experimental versions of the package may also be available at
ftp://ftp.cranfield.ac.uk/public/cc/cc047/TeX/sources .  Note that
the experimental versions may have internal inconsistencies, may
fail to work altogether, and most certainly will have incorrect
documentation.
